# Kentico Kontent Custom Element: Keyword Extractor

This [custom element](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/develop-apps/integrate/integrating-your-own-content-editing-features) for [Kentico Kontent](https://kontent.ai) gives editors a way to automatically generate keywords for an item based on the content in it. It's based on [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) to enable more dynamic functionality.

## Features

- Editors can selectively remove keywords
- Editors can manually refresh the keywords
- Multiple keyword extraction options:
  - [Pure JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/sleepycat/rapid-automated-keyword-extraction) of the RAKE (rapid automatic keyword extraction) algorithm
  - [Microsoft Azure Text Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) API (requires access key)
- Optional debug panel for diagnostics

## Setup

1. Deploy the code to a secure public host
    * See [deploying section](#Deploying) for a really quick option
1. Follow the instructions in the [Kentico Kontent documentation](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/develop-apps/integrate/integrating-your-own-content-editing-features#a-3--displaying-a-custom-element-in-kentico-kontent) to add the element to a content model.
    * The `Hosted code URL` is where you deployed to in step 1
    * Pass the necessary parameters as directed in the [JSON Parameters configuration](#json-parameters) section of this readme.

## Deploying

Netlify has made this easy. If you click the deploy button below, it will guide you through the process of deploying it to Netlify and leave you with a copy of the repository in your account as well.

## Configuring the Custom Element

You will need to add the custom element to a content type filling in the hosted code URL and the JSON parameters (see below for details). You will also need to allow the custom element to read the values of the elements you want to base keywords off of.

The JSON parameters required as as follows:

| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
|elements|array| (Required) This is the array of element codenames to extract keywords from. The specified elements must also be set as readable for the custom element. |
|azureKey|string| (Optional) This is the [access key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows#get-the-keys-for-your-resource) for your Microsoft Azure Text Analytics resource. If not provided the local Javascript extractor is used instead. |
|debug|boolean| (Optional) If present and set to true the debug panel will activate when editing a content item. |

```json
{
    "elements": [
        "summary",
        "meta_keywords",
        "title"
    ],
    "azureKey": "<YOUR_AZURE_ACCESS_KEY>",
    "debug": true
}
```
